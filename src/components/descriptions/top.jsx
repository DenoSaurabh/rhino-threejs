      African rhinos and oxpeckers (a type of bird) have a fascinating symbiotic relationship. The oxpecker stands on the rhinoâ€™s back and eats ticks and other insects that it finds on the rhino. If the oxpecker senses danger, it will always create a commotion, which helps to alert the rhino to it as well.
